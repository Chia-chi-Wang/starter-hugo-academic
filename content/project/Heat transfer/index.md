For heating elements with high power density, it is crucial to improve the heat dissipation capability through thermal interface materials, otherwise the residual air gap caused by roughness will cause a large interface thermal resistance, resulting in a significant increase in the temperature of the heating element. At present, common thermal interface materials include silicone grease, low melting point alloys, phase change materials, etc., which have different usage scenarios. The group selected three typical interface materials and compared the case without interface materials to obtain the effect of thermal interface materials on heat dissipation. Firstly, the rough surface is simplified and geometrically modeled according to the knowledge of contact mechanics. On the basis of some reasonable assumptions, the simple thermal resistance method can be used in Matlab to calculate the contact thermal resistance. The results are very close to the results of Ansys simulation. The results show that the heat dissipation effect of common soft-textured high thermal conductivity interface materials is significantly better than that of no interface material under low pressure, but the effect may be worse than that of no interface material under higher pressure. Due to the high compressibility of the phase change material after the phase change, even if the thermal conductivity is relatively small, it still has the best performance among the three tested interface materials. Through the verification with the finite element method, this paper shows that the relatively simple thermal resistance method can perform a better approximate calculation of the contact thermal resistance, and proves the importance of the thermal interface material in promoting the heat dissipation of the heating element.
