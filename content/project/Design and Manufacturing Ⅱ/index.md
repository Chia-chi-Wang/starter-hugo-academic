Umbrellas are an indispensable tool in people's daily lives, but in public places, the drying and folding of umbrellas has become an urgent problem to be solved. This paper investigates a number of literature and patents, on the basis of the existing dryer or retractor, for the integrated design and optimization, proposed an umbrella drying, retraction and folding integrated device. Modeling was carried out by SOLIDWORKS to verify its theoretical feasibility. On this basis, an umbrella drying and folding machine based on the above design is built, which integrates drying and folding in one, with high motion accuracy and robustness. Finally, the performance of the appliance was evaluated and several suggestions for improvement were made.
 This article is described in the following chapters:

1. The first chapter mainly introduces the background of the project, investigates the market and literature, and clarifies the technical bottleneck of drying and folding of umbrellas through comparative analysis of existing patents, and puts forward targets and parameter indicators. Finally, the Gantt chart of the group's tasks is presented.
2. The second chapter describes the process of proposing the integrated design scheme of umbrella drying and folding, using SOLIDWORKS to model to verify its theoretical feasibility, and computationally checking the key parts.
3. The third chapter describes the prototype structure layout and detailed design, and the prototype size and design details are explained in detail.
4. The fourth chapter introduces the calibration and selection of the drive system - the motor.
5. The fifth chapter explains the design of the control system based on stm32 and Raspberry Pi, using photoresistor sensors, Hall angle sensors, water level sensors, etc. to monitor and control the prototype in real time, and realize the closed-loop control of the connecting rod motor.
6. Chapter 6 describes the prototyping process for the group and assembles and commissions the prototype.
