At present, the development of industrial Internet such as IOT warehousing is valued by the state and enterprises, but industrial infrastructure has restricted the development of logistics and warehousing automation. The existing smart warehouses are mainly based on the "Cai Niao Smart Warehouse" model, mostly using unmanned vehicles and multi-axis robotic arms, which have high costs and low space utilization. This project draws on the characteristics of high-density storage of disks and successfully designed a three-dimensional intelligent warehouse. The conceptual design of the project was completed in SolidWorks, and the size of each component was determined through theoretical analysis and finite element method simulation; the control part was developed based on the Raspberry Pi; the program was developed based on ROS, which has good scalability and is convenient for iterative upgrades. Data storage and interactive use MySQL database application. In the actual test, the performance of the product is good, and it can stably realize the input and output of the storage box, and the robustness is high.
